    "## Handwriting detection using a Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "<p>Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of Deep Learning Algorithm that take the image as an input and learn the various features of the image through filters. This allows them to learn the important objects present in the image, allowing them to discern one image from the other. One important feature of Convolutional Neural Network that sets it apart from other Machine Learning algorithms is its ability to pre-process the data by itself. </p>\n",

The data set can be downloaded from here: <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\">MNIST Dataset</a></p>\n",
